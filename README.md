 📰 Fake News Detection

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to identify whether a given news article is fake or real.

 🧠 Project Objective

To classify news articles as *real* or *fake* based on their textual content using NLP and supervised learning algorithms.

 📁 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle Fake News Dataset
- Columns: `title`, `text`, `subject`, `date`, `label`
  - `label`: 1 for fake news, 0 for real news

 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy / re
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer
- PassiveAggressiveClassifier / Naive Bayes

 📈 Workflow

1. Text Preprocessing-
   - Lowercasing, stopword removal
   - Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization
   - Removing punctuations

2. Feature Extraction-
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

3. Model Training-
   - PassiveAggressiveClassifier
   - Multinomial Naive Bayes

4. Evaluation-
   - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-Score
